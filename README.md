# Neural Networks-Deep Learning-Assignments
My assignments from the "Neural Networks- Deep Learning"  class I took at the Computer Science department of AUTH.

I organized the code I had written as well as the conclusions and comments of the corresponding papers I submitted, so that I can review them easily and help future students and/ or other people interested in these concepts.
